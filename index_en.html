        <h1>THE "UNTOUCHABLES" APARTMENT IN THE HEART OF ANKARA</h1>
<p>The true story of one person's ten-year struggle for rights against corruption, crime, and institutional collapse in an apartment building in Ankara.</p>
<blockquote><strong>Attention Press Members:</strong></blockquote>
<blockquote>This dossier documents organized lawlessness continuing for over 10 years in an apartment building in Ankara/Çankaya, the negligence of public institutions (especially the Municipality and Prosecutor's Office), and the physical/legal violence suffered by a citizen seeking justice. The allegations in the dossier are supported by camera recordings, expert reports, official institution responses, hospital reports, and other evidence.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Despite this 60-year chain of crimes taking place before everyone's eyes, despite all complaints, continuing investigations and lawsuits, and despite being personally reported to multiple journalists, as of January 2026, it has not been reported anywhere.</blockquote>
<h2>1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In Çankaya, the most central district of Ankara (only 1.3 km from the Courthouse, at most a 10-minute walk), in an apartment building unlawfully registered as <strong>"Masonry" (Kargir)</strong> but actually built as reinforced concrete; a chain of <strong>60 years of illegal construction</strong>, <strong>Social Security/Electricity irregularities</strong>, <strong>sexual harassment incidents</strong>, and <strong>environmental crimes</strong> has been maintained for years by the apartment management and influential flat owners.</p>
<p>The whistleblower, the only flat owner objecting to these unlawful acts, has been subjected to systematic mobbing, threats ("I will haunt you", "I'll come up and f... your brains out"), blackmail ("Pervert" slander, "You say prostitution, it's very dangerous, it will backfire on you, you have a lot to learn"), and finally a severe physical attack resulting in a <strong>fractured jawbone</strong>.</p>
<p>The gravity of the incident lies not only in the crimes committed but in the <strong>systematic cover-up of these crimes by public institutions</strong>. Çankaya Municipality's misleading statements protecting the illegal structure, ASKİ ignoring the illegal drainage, the Prosecutor's Office issuing non-prosecution decisions (KYOK) citing "Legal Dispute" without examining evidence, and courts trying to close heavy penal incidents with simple fines (Pre-payment), point to the existence of an "Untouchable" structure.</p>
<h2>2. ACTORS OF THE INCIDENT AND NETWORK OF INFLUENCE</h2>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>The "Untouchable" Family:</strong> The family of a former President of the Constitutional Court (AYM), after whom the apartment is named. They own 3 flats in the building. The current auditor is a member of this family.</li>
<li>  <strong>Former Manager (Former Politician, Printer):</strong> The individual who served as manager for 20 years, allegedly a former district chairman of CHP, owner of the shop on the ground floor, and operator of a printing house for 30 years in the illegal structure in the common area.</li>
<li>  <strong>Current Manager (Architect/Constructor, Terrace Owner, Instigator):</strong> Estimated to be connected to CHP, a 50-year constructor. Owner of 3 flats, including those on the terrace. Alleged to have committed an environmental crime by opening a hole on the terrace connecting rainwater drains illegally to the sewage system.</li>
<li>  <strong>Former Manager's Son (Printer):</strong> The individual who operated the printing house for 30 years in the illegal structure with his father in the shop on the ground floor.</li>
<li>  <strong>Individual in the Concierge Apartment:</strong> An individual shown as a "tenant" by the management but alleged to be employed uninsured (illegally), against whom there are allegations of sexual harassment and prostitution, said to have a criminal record, and used as a false witness in the assault case.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. CHAIN OF CRIMES AND ALLEGATIONS</h2>
<h3>A. Zoning and Urbanization Crimes (Allegation of Municipality Cooperation)</h3>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>100m² Illegal Commercial Space:</strong> A 100-square-meter reinforced concrete illegal structure under the front garden of the apartment, not in the project but existing even during the licensing process 60 years ago (suspects openly admit this), was used as a printing workshop for years. The illegal construction fine issued by municipal teams was cancelled using influence.</li>
<li>  <strong>Misconduct in Office and Cover-up:</strong> In response to complaints made to Çankaya Municipality, municipal officials provided misleading reports stating "Since the door of the illegal structure is closed, it has become suitable for the architectural project" (despite containing statements openly admitting the illegal structure), ensuring the closure of Prosecutor's Office investigations.</li>
<li>  <strong>Title Deed Irregularity:</strong> Although the building is reinforced concrete (column-beam system), it was registered as "Masonry" in the land registry, providing advantages for 60 years.</li>
</ul>
<h3>B. Environmental and Public Health Crimes (Allegation of ASKİ Cooperation)</h3>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Illegal Drainage:</strong> The terrace floor owner Architect opened a hole connecting the terrace rainwater illegally to the building's sewage drain. This caused sewage floods in intermediate floor flats (the whistleblower's house is on the first floor) during every heavy rainfall.</li>
<li>  <strong>Ignoring:</strong> Applications to ASKİ were dismissed by saying "Indoor installation problem" (whereas the indoor sewage pipes are new), and the environmental crime was not inspected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>C. Sexual Harassment and Public Order Crimes</h3>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Concierge Apartment:</strong> Regarding the individual living in the apartment's concierge flat, there are allegations known by residents and neighbors of <strong>molestation of young women</strong>, <strong>harassment of trans individuals</strong>, and <strong>prostitution</strong>.</li>
<li>  <strong>Police Raids:</strong> Police raids on the apartment in past years and plainclothes police investigations regarding "foreign national women" in the concierge apartment strengthen these allegations.</li>
<li>  <strong>Electricity Theft:</strong> There is a sealed electricity meter by Enerjisa and fines for illegal usage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>D. Fake Lease Agreement and Social Security Fraud</h3>
<ul>
<li>  <strong>Employment of Uninsured De Facto Concierge:</strong> The individual in the concierge apartment worked as a concierge, collected garbage, and cleaned the common areas of the apartment for years, but was kept out of SGK audits by having a lease agreement signed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>E. Violence, Threats, and Assault (Attacks of June 14 and December 24, 2024)</h3>
<ul>
<li>  The whistleblower gave 2 warning letters to the management due to the illegal structure and other irregularities, and for this reason, was subjected to <strong>insults, blackmail, and threats</strong> in June 2024. He complained to the Prosecutor's Office about the "Pervert" blackmail.</li>
<li>  The whistleblower was ambushed in front of the apartment by the Manager and his Son, whom the municipality had fined due to the illegal structure.</li>
<li>  As a result of the attack, the whistleblower's <strong>jawbone was broken</strong>, he underwent long-term treatment and a 6-week jaw fixation procedure. Health problems continue.</li>
<li>  During the attack, the whistleblower's 91-year-old mother witnessed the event, was repeatedly subjected to profanity-laced insults, and was taken to intensive care with a risk of heart attack and underwent surgery. Health problems continue.</li>
<li>  <strong>Evidence:</strong> These events in June and December were recorded second by second by the whistleblower's mobile and vehicle cameras. Expert reports for both events are available.</li>
<li>  Due to continuing threats, the whistleblower had to leave his treatment incomplete and secretly flee his home with his mother in the middle of the night in March 2025, moving his residence out of the city. The judiciary rejected protection order requests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. LEGAL PROCESS AND JUDICIAL PROBLEMS</h2>
<p>The legal struggle reveals the blockage in the judiciary and the policy of "trivialization":</p>
<p>1.  <strong>Assault Case:</strong> Despite severe injury (bone fracture), the process moves slowly, and the attackers are tried without arrest. The instigator suspect who made threats and challenged the judiciary was not included in the case. The individual in the concierge apartment is used as a false witness.</p>
<p>2.  <strong>Insult/"Pervert" Blackmail Case:</strong> The "Pervert" slander and insults concocted by the instigator, manager, and his son to intimidate the whistleblower are attempted to be closed with <strong>Pre-payment (Fine)</strong> by the court, considering them as isolated "simple insults". However, this action is an organized blackmail aiming to hide the crime chain and intending to have cameras removed to prevent obtaining evidence of their planned assault.</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Civil Servant Crimes (Non-Prosecution):</strong> Complaints of "Misconduct in Office" and "Covering up Crime" against Çankaya Municipality officials were closed (Non-Prosecution) by the Prosecutor's Office Civil Servant Crimes Bureau relying on the cover-up response of the accused Municipality.</p>
<p>4.  <strong>General Criminal Complaint (Non-Prosecution):</strong> The comprehensive criminal complaint (Organized crime, sexual harassment, fraud, etc.) submitted by the whistleblower with 13 pages, 11 pieces of evidence, and 15 witnesses was rejected by the prosecutor's office as "Legal Dispute" without reading it.</p>
<p>5.  <strong>Analysis vs. Synthesis:</strong> The judiciary tries to analyze everything by breaking it down into small pieces and punishing each individually. Due to this lack of synthesis, this entire chain of crimes is oversimplified, leaving the court with only trivial insult cases and isolated assault incidents that can be closed with a monetary fine. With this approach, a 15-minute camera recording and an 18-page expert report full of insults, threats, intimidation, blackmail/slander, confessions, and challenges to justice are reduced to a single-word "Pervert" insult case that takes only one second to utter. Just like insult cases between people who meet for the first time in traffic and fight. No one looks at the big picture. <strong>This is not "divide and conquer"; it is "divide and simplify," until nothing significant enough to judge remains.</strong></p>

<h2>6. NOTES FOR JOURNALISTS AND QUESTION SET</h2>
<p>We ask you to examine this dossier, which seems "local" but actually summarizes Turkey's system of "impunity" and "lack of inspection".</p>
<p><strong>Things to Question:</strong></p>
<p>1.  <strong>Çankaya Municipality:</strong> How was a 60-year-old reinforced concrete illegal structure "not seen" despite existing during licensing, openly admitted by suspects in camera recordings and written documents, and complained about multiple times? How was a reinforced concrete apartment registered as masonry in the title deed?</p>
<p>2.  <strong>ASKİ:</strong> How is the illegal drainage on the terrace ignored despite complaints and all evidence, and covered up as a first-floor plumbing problem without any inspection?</p>
<p>3.  <strong>Prosecutor's Office:</strong> Why are files containing sexual harassment allegations and suspicion of organized crime closed as "Legal Dispute"? How is a 60-year-old illegal structure accepted as if it could be covered up without Municipality assistance despite all evidence? How is this entire chain of crimes seen as a simple insult closed with pre-payment and an isolated assault? Why are protection and injunction requests rejected?</p>
<p>4.  <strong>Ministry of Interior:</strong> How can an individual with a criminal record and suspicion of harassment be employed unsupervised in collective living areas like apartments?</p>
<p>5.  <strong>Use of Political/Bureaucratic Influence:</strong> How are cover-up responses repeatedly given to judicial and administrative authorities from municipalities? How are illegal construction fines cancelled? Does CHP's tutelage regime still continue?</p>
<p>6. <strong>Is the State's Power Only Enough for the Ordinary Citizen?:</strong> While the state writes an illegal construction fine to a citizen who built a 3m² PVC cabinet in his own garden for his bicycle, why does it ignore the 100m² reinforced concrete illegal structure in the common area of an apartment in the heart of Ankara for 60 years? Why did the state, which is a hawk when collecting dues, turn into a crow when it comes to this chain of crimes continuing for 60 years?</p>
