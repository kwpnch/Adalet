# FIGHT FOR JUSTICE

The true story of one person's ten-year struggle for rights against corruption, crime, and institutional collapse in an apartment building in Ankara.

## SUMMARY

### Struggle in the Apartment

For over a decade, they made apartment life unbearable. Even the summary is as long as below, and this is just the beginning:

- **They used the front garden with an illegal structure:** They filled the 100m2 reinforced concrete illegal structure under the front garden, which is the common area of the apartment, with printing machines and used it for 30 years. In fact, this illegal structure existed during the first licensing 60 years ago. So, the Municipality has been involved from the very beginning.

- **They placed an acquaintance with a criminal record in the janitor's apartment:** To defraud the SGK (Social Security Institution), they showed the janitor as a tenant and employed him without insurance. The man didn't do any work properly anyway, and then he quit completely. I cleaned the apartment from our floor down many times.

- **They drilled a hole in the terrace and directed rainwater into the sewage pipe:** For 8 years, my apartment on the first floor was flooded during every heavy rain.

- **They had the reinforced concrete apartment registered as [Masonry](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/TapuUsulsuzlugu/Tapu.pdf) in the title deed:** There are columns and beams in the building. They have been gaining advantage for 60 years.

- **There are allegations of sexual harassment, molestation, and prostitution:** The individual living in the janitor's apartment for free did not stay still; there are incidents of harassment and molestation against young girls and even trans individuals. The police raided the janitor's apartment many times. Plainclothes police officers investigated the janitor's apartment asking "has anyone seen foreign national women". I used to wait for my sister at the windows when she was coming.

- **They let the janitor's apartment use electricity illegally:** Enerjisa sealed the apartment's electricity meter many times, leaving the apartment without electricity.

- **Moreover, the management and their instigators supported all these crimes and criminals:** They openly confessed everything and said "so what", "what part of us is right anyway".

- **They intimidated everyone with insults and threats, I was left alone:** They tried to silence everyone who objected to these unlawfulnesses, especially me, by shouting, insulting, and threatening. I was the only one left struggling against these in the apartment; everyone else fell silent. Everyone who passed for a "decent" person and claimed to support justice disappeared, I was left alone.

- **Finally, they tried to silence me by breaking my jaw:** Because I did not bow to insults and threats and filed a complaint, they finally tried to silence me by assaulting me and breaking my jaw. With verbal violence, they hospitalized my 91-year-old mother; [she had surgery](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/Darp/AnnemRapor.pdf).

- **They decided to demolish the apartment to destroy evidence:** While my treatment was ongoing, my jaw fixed and unable to eat or speak, together with all those "decent" people, [they held a meeting where they openly confessed to the illegal structure](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/Apt%20Toplanti%20Daveti.jpeg) and by majority vote decided to demolish the apartment that had been renovated just 2 years ago. Police chiefs, lawyers, mediators, teachers, that is, all those "decent" people from every profession united with these crime machines.

- **They are blinded by money:** I was the only homeowner living full-time in the apartment anyway, the others were just eating tenant money. Therefore, they didn't care that the apartment was in filth, flooded with sewage water, or that the man in the janitor's apartment was harassing young girls (if they raped someone, they would say "so what" and turn their backs and leave). Now, when the illegal structure, SGK, illegal drainage, title deed irregularity, and other penalty possibilities emerged, that is, when the subject became money, they changed sides without any shame. "Justice" was immediately thrown into the trash. They gave up morality for money.

- **We had to move to another place because the threats continued:** The manager who assaulted me was waiting at the entrance of the apartment with a stick, so I couldn't go to my treatment for 2 weeks. Because they walked over me when they saw me, I could only go grocery shopping after 8 pm. The manager was disturbing me by hitting the ceiling of the shop (the floor of my apartment) with a stick. Since the threats and harassment did not end, we left our apartment and the city in the middle of the night, leaving my treatment unfinished.

In this country, when it comes to money and personal interest, the first things to go into the trash are always justice and morality. They try to console themselves by saying "Well, the world is like this, what can we do". People who defend justice and morality and are truly decent are labeled as "abnormal, asocial, anti-social", "characterless" and "troublemaker" (In the first hearing of the assault case, the defendant's lawyer started to explain that my character is bad by analyzing my character, fortunately the judge stopped him saying "let's not get into those subjects"). This is how they brought not only this apartment but this entire country to this state.

However, the rule is this: Before you start talking about the country's problems, you will clean your own backyard. While the sons of the homeland fall martyr to protect the borders, if you sit on your ass and do not intervene even in what is happening right next to you on the homeland soil, if you close your eyes and plug your ears, the homeland is already lost. Who is the real enemy and where? Look right next to you first. Look in the mirror first!

### Struggle in Exile

The above was just the beginning. Now a legal struggle that would last for years had begun.

#### Insult and Assault cases

A few months after I went to my new residence address, I saw that two lawsuits were filed:

- **Insult case:** In fact, about 8 months after I complained about this act which had the purpose of blackmail with the insult "Pervert", an insult lawsuit was filed. Since the court saw this as a simple, isolated insult, despite all my declaration petitions, it decided on HAGB (Deferral of the Announcement of the Verdict) with simple procedure. Although it was completely in my favor, [I objected to the decision](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/SantajHakaret/HakaretKararinaI%CC%87tiraz_TevhitTalebi.pdf). The court accepted it and the case file was given to another court. The new court, simplifying the event even further, accepted it as a crime qualification that can be closed with prepayment and is about to drop the case. Besides, the Prosecutor's Office had given a Decision of Non-Prosecution (KYOK) to my illegal structure report in the same complaint.

- **Assault case:** The defendants used the man in the janitor's apartment as a false witness twice and tried to show me as the aggressor. The first one was rejected by the Criminal Judgeship of Peace on Duty. In the second one, the judge looking at the assault case listened to the false witness. But the court still sees this assault act where they broke my jaw as an isolated ordinary assault; therefore, a lawsuit continues as if it has nothing to do with the events above.

#### My criminal chain complaints

When I saw that the insult and assault cases were being tried as isolated events independent of this crime chain that has been going on for decades and that my lawyer also supported this, I realized that it was up to me. Otherwise, there would be no difference from insult and assault cases between people arguing and fighting in traffic.

Therefore, I started to complain about this entire crime chain to judicial and administrative authorities:

- **Illegal structure:** I complained about the illegal structure in the front garden of the apartment to judicial and administrative authorities a total of 3 times:

    1. While complaining to the Prosecutor's Office about the "Pervert" insult blackmail
    2. To the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change via CİMER 3 weeks before the assault incident [via CİMER complaint](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/EK%205-6-7%20CIMERSikayeti_KYOKKarari_BirlestirmeDilekcesi.pdf)
    3. While complaining about the cover-up answers of Çankaya Municipality
    
    Çankaya Municipality covered up the illegal structure by giving misleading and mocking answers to the Prosecutor's Office's first letter saying "since the door of the illegal structure is closed, it has become suitable for the architectural plan, there is no other action to be done" and to the Ministry saying "we could not enter the relevant place".
    
    Upon this, [I filed a new criminal complaint](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/KacakYapiOrtbas.pdf) to the Prosecutor's Office regarding the cover-up of the illegal structure against the Municipality and other suspects. The Prosecutor's Office Civil Servant Crimes Bureau wrote a letter to the accused Municipality again and asked about the illegal structure. In its reply, the Municipality used the expression "illegal structure" twice and gave a cover-up answer again saying "the entrance of the illegal structure was closed and there was nothing left to do". The Prosecutor's Office Bureau, which respected this, also gave a [Decision of Non-Prosecution](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/%282%29_Takipsizlik_Karari.pdf) regarding my new complaint.
    
    Since this situation created an absurd result as if these individuals had been protecting the 60-year-old 100m2 reinforced concrete illegal structure on their own for 60 years and the contradictory cover-up answers given by the Municipality did not exist, of course [I objected at the Criminal Judgeship of Peace](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/KacakYapiOrtbasKYOKItiraz.pdf). We are waiting for the result.

- **Janitor's apartment:** I sent a [13-page complaint petition](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KapiciDairesi/KapiciDairesi.pdf) to the Prosecutor's Office, reporting very serious crimes consisting of 11 evidences and 15 witnesses:

    - Defrauding the SGK by showing the uninsured janitor as a tenant
    - Sexual harassment and molestation incidents and prostitution allegations regarding the individual living in the janitor's apartment
    - Defrauding Enerjisa by making the individual living in the janitor's apartment use the apartment's electricity illegally
    - Swear words my mother was subjected to
    - Cover-ups with high-level influence peddling
    
    To this carefully prepared petition, the Prosecutor's Office Forgery and Fraud Bureau gave a [Decision of Non-Prosecution](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KapiciDairesi/%282%29_Takipsizlik_Karari.pdf) within just a few days. Actually, not much was written in the Non-Prosecution decision, because 6.5 pages of the 7-page decision text was a copy-paste version of my petition with broken formatting. Other parts of the decision text were full of errors and finally, the Prosecutor's Office Bureau claimed that all these issues I filed a criminal complaint about were "legal disputes". In other words, everything I reported, including sexual harassment incidents, was a legal dispute!
    
    Of course, [I objected to this dismissive Non-Prosecution decision at the Criminal Judgeship of Peace](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KapiciDairesi/KapiciDairesiKYOKItiraz.pdf). Before objecting, I made the complaints to ASKİ, TKGM, and SGK myself, which the Prosecutor's Office should have actually done. We are waiting for the result of my objection.

- **Illegal drainage:** I complained twice to the Ankara Metropolitan Municipality ASKİ via CİMER about the illegal drainage system on the terrace that caused my apartment to flood. [To the first one](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/YasaDisiDrenaj/ASKISikayet_1.pdf), they gave an irrelevant answer about the sewage problem of an apartment elsewhere in Ankara. [To my second application](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/YasaDisiDrenaj/ASKISikayet_2.pdf) for correction, I received an absurd answer that a process was required in the installation of my apartment on the first floor regarding the hole in the terrace. In other words, this time too, ASKİ ignored the hole in the terrace and the illegal drainage and covered it up.

    Since I wasn't even in Ankara, this answer they gave without even entering my apartment and making an inspection led to an absurd result as if the reason for water gushing into my kitchen during every heavy rain was the brand new sewage pipes in my first floor apartment, so I submitted a criminal complaint petition to the Prosecutor's Office about ASKİ and the individuals who opened the hole in the terrace. We are waiting for the result.

- **Title deed irregularity:** I complained twice via CİMER to the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change General Directorate of Land Registry and Cadastre that the apartment, which is actually Reinforced Concrete, was registered as Masonry in the title deed. [In the answer given by Çankaya Land Registry Directorate](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/TapuUsulsuzlugu/CIMER_CankayaTapu.pdf), they directed me to the Ankara Cadastre Directorate (I don't know why they didn't correspond among themselves regarding such a serious irregularity). [Ankara Cadastre Directorate](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/TapuUsulsuzlugu/CIMER_AnkaraKadastro.pdf), ignoring the irregularity and public loss, mentioned in my complaint, gave the answer that "interested parties should apply with a declaration" as if my application was just a request for a type change. Upon these evasive answers, [I filed a criminal complaint to the Prosecutor's Office](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/TapuUsulsuzlugu/TapuUsulsuzlugu.pdf) regarding those responsible. We are waiting for the result.

- **SGK fraud:** [I complained to the SGK](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KapiciDairesi/SGKSikayet.pdf) about the irregularity regarding showing the individual in the janitor's apartment as a tenant. We are waiting for the result.

- **Protection order requests:** I don't even remember how many times I requested a protection order. [Our first protection order request was rejected](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/Darp/KorumaTalebiReddedildi.pdf). I don't know what happened or will happen to the others.

- **Injunction order requests:** After these complaints of mine, to destroy the evidence, they tried to get the apartment demolished under the pretext of urban transformation, which had been renovated just 2 years ago. [Cores were taken](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/DepremTeknikInceleme.jpeg) from the columns. For this reason, [I requested an injunction order](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/KacakYapiOrtbasSCHEkBeyan.pdf) regarding the apartment from the Prosecutor's Office and the Courts until the investigations were completed. To my first injunction request, the Prosecutor's Office Civil Servant Crimes Bureau given a [Decision of Non-Prosecution](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/TedbirTalebi/%282%29_Takipsizlik_Karari.pdf), but sent my request to the separated investigation file regarding other suspects with a writ. We are waiting for the result.

### Against Whom Am I Struggling

So, where do all these unlawfulnesses take place? Why do CHP Municipalities cover up these crimes? Who are these "untouchables"? What is special about this apartment?

- The prominent name of the family that gave its name to the apartment is the **former President of the Constitutional Court**, this family has owned 3 apartments for 60 years.
- The person who has been the apartment manager for 20 years and has been using the illegal structure for 30 years is a former politician who is said to have been a district chairman in **CHP**.
- The current apartment manager is a **50-year architect/builder** with CHP connections.
- The current apartment auditor is a member of the family that gave its name to the apartment.

**I have reported all of these many times to many media organizations and columnists via e-mail or X (Twitter [@kwpnch](https://x.com/kwpnch))**. No one has returned yet.

## CHRONOLOGICAL DETAILS

### 2014-2015

I bought the apartment in "Untouchables Apartment" at the end of 2014. How could I know that it was the apartment of arrogant crime machines who thought they were untouchable.

I realized something was wrong at the first apartment meeting I attended in February 2015. Because, it was a meeting that passed with fights, which I thought were stories of the past, they were silencing people by shouting.

I had my apartment completely renovated and moved in at the beginning of May.

### 2016

#### Construction of illegal drainage

I learned many truths at the meeting in March 2016. The architect individual who owned the apartments on the terrace floor wanted the meeting. He was going to have the waterproofing of the terrace done, because the apartment under the terrace was also his and I guess the ceiling was turning yellow. Money was collected from everyone.

At the meeting, I realized that this builder individual was actually an expert in illegal works. When he said he would open a hole in the terrace and direct the rainwater into the sewage pipe, I said that directing rainwater into the sewage system was an environmental and public health crime with a penalty and that it would flood the apartment. I received the answer "what part of us is right anyway".

Indeed, during the following 8 years, my house was flooded in every heavy rain. Water was gushing, not dripping. We were trying to catch the gushing water with buckets.

#### Silencing of our neighbor across

Arguments also broke out about the person in the janitor's apartment at the meeting. I was still trying to understand. Our neighbor across, who was the same age as my mother, wanted the man removed from there. They silenced the woman by shouting. The woman had started to stomp on the chair she was sitting on unless. I still thought our neighbor across wanted him removed because she was not satisfied with the work the janitor did; which indeed he was doing terrible cleaning, actually the only job he did was just collecting the trash in the evenings.

This meeting in 2016 was the last apartment meeting I attended.

### 2017-2018

We had started to learn about the incidents of the individual in the janitor's apartment.

#### Police raids

Sometimes there were police raids. Since I saw women coming in and going out, I understood why there was a police raid. The man was saying that those foreign national women were his relatives; they were relatives coming from Central Asian Turkic republics. How many foreign national women relatives he had.

#### Prostitution allegations

In 2017, we entered the apartment with the plumber I called for a job in my apartment. Just at that moment, we saw 2 women and 2 men climbing the stairs from the basement floor where the janitor's apartment is located to the ground floor. When they saw us, they left the apartment as if escaping. The janitor below, who noticed us, shouted after them "I wait for you again, come again".

After we went up and entered my apartment on the first floor, the master turned to me and before I even said anything, simply said "look at that guy, he turned the place into a brothel". Even a person coming to the apartment for the first time immediately understood what was going on in the janitor's apartment.

#### Police interrogations

I think around those dates again, we were leaving my apartment with my mother. We saw someone climbing the stairs towards our door. He showed his ID; he was a plainclothes police officer. He asked in a low voice "have you seen foreign national women in the janitor's apartment?". We said we saw people coming in and going out, but we had no information. We said neighbors in the upper apartments might know, because we had heard such complaints from neighbors 2 floors up.

#### Defrauding of our neighbor across

In the summer of 2018, while we were away, we learned that our elderly neighbor across was defrauded by people introducing themselves as Prosecutors or Police and lost all her money in the bank.

### 2019

#### Molestation of a young girl

I think in the spring of 2019, our door bell rang around 10 pm one night. I opened it. I saw 10-15 young men lined up down the stairs. The young man who rang our door asked "brother, is there anyone fitting this description around here?". I said the person fitting the description he described was the janitor individual and asked why they were looking for him. The young man said his girlfriend lived in this apartment and that individual harassed the girl by trying to kiss her. I advised them to call the police so they wouldn't get into trouble, saying I understood what they were going to do.

The young men went to the janitor's apartment and knocked on his door. The man did not open the door. They started waiting outside. Since my apartment was on the first floor, I could see almost everything. A few minutes later the man came out; the young men caught the man and assaulted him. Finally the police came, but since they moved away from our apartment, I couldn't hear what they were talking about. I don't know if anyone filed a complaint or if a report was prepared.

The next day, we went down with my mother and told everything to the manager's son who runs the printing shop. The manager's son said "then let's remove him immediately". I asked who this janitor was; he said he didn't know. I said who brought this; he said "I don't know". Later I learned that the janitor individual was actually their acquaintance (it is even said that he is a distant relative) and he and his manager father were the ones who found and brought the man.

Of course, nothing was done to the janitor, we complained in vain; who are you complaining to anyway.

#### Collecting signatures to become manager

Around the same dates, the manager father was going door to door collecting signatures as if a meeting had been held and trying to get himself elected manager again. Besides, he hadn't held any meetings since 2016. While asking for signatures, he was saying he would apply for a loan, so he needed to be the manager (I don't know what kind of loan). We didn't cause difficulties, we signed. At that time, I still thought if I acted humanely, they would understand and address the problems in the apartment. It turned out they were the head of the problems themselves.

#### Death of our neighbor across

When we returned home at the end of 2019, we learned that our elderly neighbor across, who struggled against the manager and the builder on the terrace, passed away in the summer months. From what we learned from neighbors, the Prosecutor's Office found her death suspicious and started an investigation, but I don't know what happened in the end. Everything that happened to that woman happened while we were not there for some reason.

### 2020

At the beginning of 2020, before the epidemic started yet, I was abroad. A meeting was held, only fights happened again. So, a sham meeting was held.

#### Constantly breaking intercom system

Again after returning from abroad at the beginning of 2020, I noticed that the intercom was not working. The motherboard of the intercom was in the janitor's apartment. I went, saw that the power cables of the card were unplugged. I asked the janitor man, he said "I don't know". I plugged the cables back in, the intercom worked. The neighbors in the apartment thanked me. I even went to the printing shop and told the manager's son that I suspected this was intentional; how could I know he knew everything.

After a few weeks passed, I saw the intercom was not working again. I went down again, the power cables were unplugged again. I asked the man in the janitor's apartment again, this time he confessed, the circuit elements on the intercom card were making too much noise, so he was unplugging the power cables. I plugged the cables back in and told the manager's son what happened again.

At that moment, I noticed that the manager's son did not like the fact that I was pursuing these problems in the apartment. I understood then that nothing would be done about the janitor.

#### Illegal electricity usage

Only a few days later, I noticed the intercom was not working again and left my apartment to go down to the janitor's apartment. But although there was electricity in my apartment, the apartment's lighting lamps were not on. So, the intercom was not working because the apartment's electricity was cut.

When I went down to the entrance floor, I found Enerjisa's illegal electricity penalty slip on the floor. Indeed, a seal was attached to the apartment's electricity meter. A wire that was obviously used for illegal electricity was standing unplugged next to the meter.

I took the penalty and took it to the manager. The manager was at the printing shop. He claimed Enerjisa issued the penalty wrongly. I saw that he gave evasive, nonsensical and mocking answers to all the questions I asked.

Then, the manager gave money to his acquaintance in the janitor's apartment. The man immediately went to pay the penalty. But before he went, he had already removed the seal and raised the switch.

I was now sure that the manager and his son knew everything going on in the janitor's apartment and were protecting the janitor man. Besides, I had seen many times that the janitor man got his tea and even his food from the printing shop; they were very close.

### 2023

#### Renovation of the apartment

At the beginning of 2023, while I was abroad again, they held another meeting. They decided to do works such as completely repairing and painting the exterior of the apartment, repairing the main water collector and pipes. Indeed, after I returned from abroad, they were all done; the apartment was renovated from start to finish.

### 2024

#### Flooding of my kitchen

At the end of April, severe heavy rains occurred in Ankara and water started gushing into my kitchen again. We were trying to catch the gushing water with buckets in the middle of the night. This time I [video recorded](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/YasaDisiDrenaj/MutfagiSuBasti.mp4) it all. I sent the video to both the manager and the builder who owns the terrace. I said that hole must be closed now.

The manager said what's it to me, go talk to the builder individual. The builder individual said okay, get it closed. He was taking it easy because he saw the camera recording. But they had no intention of doing anything themselves.

So it fell on me. They made the man they victimized close the hole, [I paid the money too](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/YasaDisiDrenaj/TerasDelikMakbuzu.png).

At that time, we also had the same master repair the pipes of the upper floor. Actually, when it wasn't raining, that is, only in tap water usage, there was no apparent problem, but the installation on the upper floor also needed to be done. Years later, they finally had their installations repaired too.

#### Harassment of trans individual

Just when we said everything was on track, only a few days later at the beginning of May, we woke up Saturday morning early with the shouts of an individual: She was shouting "I am being harassed, help, isn't there anyone, someone take me into their home".

It turned out that the man in the janitor's apartment was harassing a trans individual. Our female neighbor living in the apartment on the entrance floor and another neighbor going to work at that time also witnessed the incident. After the incident, our neighbor on the entrance floor came and told us what happened.

I said enough is enough. I wrote a notice draft explaining this last harassment incident and demanding the immediate removal of the individual in the janitor's apartment. I gave the draft to the apartment residents and flat owners whose phone numbers I knew via WhatsApp, and to the others by getting printouts from the copy shop (I paid all expenses from my own pocket).

#### Auditor meeting

On May 6, 2024, the manager called and called me to the printing shop. He heard about the notice draft. He told me the lie that he couldn't remove the janitor man and that the man threatened to complain to SGK to extract money from the apartment. I said "it doesn't matter what penalty SGK writes, I don't care". I was talking about sexual harassment, he was answering as money.

On May 7, 2024, an auditor meeting was held. The individual in the janitor's apartment was questioned by the auditor and me regarding the harassment incident and all his other incidents. He gave answers mocking our minds to everything we asked.

At that meeting, I realized that the auditor was a well-intentioned person who knew nothing. Because, after listening to the nonsense the individual said at the meeting, he said "either he leaves the janitor's apartment or we go to court". So I understood that he didn't know the janitor was actually the manager's relative or close one. He also believed the lie that the janitor was trying to extract money from SGK and that the manager couldn't remove the man because he was trying to protect the apartment.

In the auditor meeting, the manager completely supported the janitor man, protected him, and tried to simplify all his incidents. He even tried to sic the janitor on me. Regarding the girl sexually harassed by the janitor, the manager said for the janitor "so what if he touched the young girl's shoulder". Because I didn't believe the lies the manager told, he called me "thick-headed, don't you get it" and hurled swear words.

The manager also called the female neighbor who witnessed the harassment incident to the meeting. But when he scolded the woman because she gave statements against the janitor, our neighbor had to say "you can't talk to me like that".

They decided to hold an apartment meeting to discuss these issues during the auditor meeting. I asked the auditor to ensure that tenants also participate in the meeting to be held, he accepted, said we'll take the tenants in and listen to them at some point.

Later, the management announced that they decided to hold an apartment meeting on June 14.

#### Notices

My main rule in all these events has always been this: As he attacks, you shift up a gear.

In accordance with this rule, I added all these details about the auditor meeting to the notice. Also, I increased the number of notices to two. The first was about the [janitor's apartment](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KapiciDairesi/Ihtarname_KapiciDairesi_100624.pdf) and the second was about the [illegal structure](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/KacakYapiIhtarname.pdf) under the front garden of the apartment. I now fully understood that the manager and his son occupied both the janitor's apartment and the front garden of the apartment.

Indeed, I had to enter the illegal structure under the front garden, which they filled with printing machines and used, many times in the 9 years that passed until 2024. Because, when I went down to the shop regarding all the problems in the apartment, I usually couldn't find them on the ground floor, they were at the printing machines in the illegal structure.

#### Everyone cowed

I shared the final version of the notices with almost everyone again, said come and sign. But, in the more than 1 month that passed since the auditor meeting, no one came and signed. Those who said "We support you, we are behind you" disappeared.

#### Threats by phone

On June 5, the manager's son called by phone. He hurled threats saying "You are talking back and forth about me, you are mentioning the illegal structure to people, don't mention it, I will come up and f.ck your brain".

I immediately went to the police station and filed a complaint and sent my statement to those in the apartment. But as I learned later, since there was no voice recording, the Prosecutor's Office gave a Decision of Non-Prosecution.

#### I sent the notices

I saw no one was coming, and the meeting date approached. On June 10, 2024, I sent both notices to the management by registered mail with return receipt.

They received the notices the next day. In the time until the meeting day, I could hear them talking loudly in the shop below. They were saying they found a way to silence me. The manager was saying to someone "I found this as a solution without going to court". They were planning something for the meeting day.

Before June 14, I informed everyone by message that I would not attend the meeting, but I would wait at the entrance of the apartment on the meeting day.

#### June 14 meeting

On June 14, the meeting was going to start at 12 noon. As I promised, I went out to the apartment door. I waited for people to come for half an hour, not a single person came.

Instead of them, this manager, his instigator and the manager's son came out of the shop and walked over me, hurled insults and threats. There was nothing they didn't do to intimidate me.

I recorded all of this with my mobile phone camera for 15 minutes. Later, the video resolution of this camera recording was made in an [18-page expert report](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/SantajHakaret/CBS%20Bilirkisi%20Raporu%20-%20evrak_11700177910.pdf) by the Prosecutor's Office. In the video and expert report, they were openly confessing to the illegal structure and challenging the judiciary/justice. The manager's son was saying he complained to get my dashcam facing my car on the living room window removed. But I didn't even care, I didn't remove the camera. Good thing I didn't, because I got the only camera recording of the assault incident thanks to that camera. Besides, one of the purposes of the "Pervert" blackmail they did at that time was to get that camera removed; I understood this in the assault incident 6 months later.

#### I hired a lawyer

After what I experienced on June 14, I decided to hire a lawyer. Besides, in the camera recording, they were repeatedly forcing me to file a lawsuit; saying "come on sue us", "you will hire a lawyer, sir".

After hiring a lawyer, I left Ankara.

#### December 2024: Insult blackmail and illegal structure complaints

The lawyer I hired did nothing for 6 months. Therefore, rushing a bit, I returned to Ankara at the beginning of December. I rushed because the time to complain about the "Pervert" blackmail was about to expire.

In Ankara, first, I received the Decision of Non-Prosecution for my phone threat complaint from the Prosecutor's Office.

Then, although my lawyer was supposed to complain, since he didn't do anything about this either, I went to the Prosecutor's Office myself and [complained about the "Pervert" insult and blackmail on June 14](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/SantajHakaret/TehditHakaretSikayet.jpg). The prosecutor asked why this individual insulted me like this; I mentioned the illegal structure. Therefore, they took my complaint as both "Pervert" insult and illegal structure. So, two investigations were conducted regarding my complaint. Indeed, months later an insult lawsuit was filed, but a Non-Prosecution decision was given regarding the illegal structure, I will mention it again below.

Also, on December 2, I sent a complaint petition regarding the illegal structure to the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change via CİMER. They also wrote to Çankaya Municipality like the Prosecutor's Office and closed the subject months later by respecting the cover-up answer coming from the Municipality.

#### Assault incident

It turns out that after my complaints to Çankaya Municipality, Municipality teams came to the apartment and wrote a penalty for the illegal structure to the manager and his son.

On December 24, around noon, I was going to take my mother to the hospital for an eye exam. I went down to wipe the windows of my car. Just as I was about to finish, the manager came out of the shop and started "aren't you ashamed". I headed towards the entrance of the apartment to not engage, he came running, cut me off, grabbed my collar and said "you will complain about us and get us fined huh".

I barely saved myself. Hoping he might back off, I took out my mobile phone and started recording. But, father and son started chasing me. They were trying to get me inside saying "come and take a look inside", who knows what they would do to me in the basement floor. Meanwhile, they were hurling threats saying "I will f.ck your ass". I looked for police around, but couldn't find any.

I had to return to take my mother to the hospital. As I approached the car, his father hit my hand and dropped my phone to the ground. Just as I leaned forward and tried to pick up the phone, he started kicking and punching; I can't even remember if I could pick up the mobile phone from the ground. As I straightened up saying "what are you doing", his son was looking for an opportunity, came flying from my right rear and threw a very violent punch (my right jaw still hasn't healed). Maybe, they hit at the same time with his father, because I flew so much that I fell to the ground a few meters away, my head hit the ground, my hat, glasses, phone, house key etc. scattered everywhere. Father and son continued kicking and hitting while I was on the ground. At one point I saved myself and moved away in the street.

But my belongings were scattered around. When I returned to collect them, they attacked again. This time I tried to escape towards the park, but they caught me again, laid me on the ground. First his son punched my left face, right on my jaw many times, I guess that's when they broke my jaw. Then they laid me face down and got on top of me. While his son was throwing punches at my head, his father was trying to tear my mouth by sticking his fingers in.

At that moment, my mother saw everything happening from the living room window next to the camera and was shouting help. Couriers and a few people around who heard my mother's shouts at the window came and took them off me. When I saved myself, I went to the street and tried to collect my belongings again, I found my hat and glasses, but my mobile phone was still missing.

One of the courier youths didn't go, stayed with me. Since I didn't have a phone, I asked him, he called the police.

Meanwhile, the manager's son was insulting my mother at the window saying "F.ck off". Together with his father, they were insulting both me and my mother saying "he is trouble, maniac". They were saying to my mother "we warned your son".

Upon saying "f.ck off" to my mother for the 9th time, I said to his son from the opposite sidewalk "you cannot talk to my mother like that". He came running, tried to assault me again. The courier youth intervened and stopped him. Indeed, the courier youth waited until the police came. They attacked me a few more times until the police came and he intervened. I owe thanks to that courier youth.

At one point, somehow, I saw that my mobile phone was under the car two back from my car. Whereas, while I was looking for the phone, they were mocking saying "it's gone gone", as it turned out they kicked my phone and it went under that car. I went, took my phone immediately. At that moment they ran behind me and tried to prevent me, but I found my phone. The phone was broken.

About 10 Turktelekom employees who saw the incident came out, called me to their side, said "come here, they can't do anything to you here"; I went to them, waited for the police there.

When the police came, I told the event to the police. At that time my mother came down, while going up together the police told me to get a report and go to the police station; I went up with my mother.

#### Emergency Service

Since I didn't have much time when I went up, I just cut the power to the camera. I couldn't check the camera recording and couldn't save it to CD. I didn't know at that time, but the camera recorded all of these. That camera used to stop sometimes, but luckily this time it recorded everything.

My mother called my sister, she came after a while. I took the camera with me, we went to Hacettepe Emergency Service.

They examined me in the ER and prepared the first forensic report. I took the report, just as I was about to go to the police station, my mother was brought to the same emergency service by ambulance. My mother was about to have a heart attack. A young girl living in the apartment saw her, called the ambulance and waited with her until it came.

They took my mother to intensive care, did blood tests. since I had to go to the police station, my sister stayed with her.

#### Police Station

At the police station, these father and son individuals were also there. They sat me in a place away from them. But, his father came and tried to intimidate me by shaking his head so that I wouldn't complain. I complained to the police there; they moved him away from me. Seeing this, the people around were saying get well soon to me.

I gave my statement, gave the first report and complained about them. The police told me to go to my mother immediately.

Just as I was leaving the door, his father was waiting at the door. He hurled insults saying "faggot". I entered the police station again, complained to the commissioner waiting at the door; the commissioner put the man into the police station by holding his arm.

#### Emergency Service Again

When I returned to the emergency service, my mother was still in intensive care. I took soup and bread from someone distributing for charity at the entrance of the ER. But, I couldn't even chew soft bread on either side of my jaw. I could only drink the soup.

I realized something was wrong with my jaw. I entered the emergency service again and said I couldn't even chew soft bread. This time, they did a CT scan and about half an hour later said my jaw was broken. They did a more detailed neurological check and asked me to go to Orthodontics at the Dental Faculty regarding the jaw fracture in the morning.

Meanwhile, while waiting for my mother's test results, we thought about discharging my mother at one point; good thing we didn't. Because, in the blood test results, they noticed that my mother's cardiac enzymes were borderline high and she could [have a heart attack](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/Darp/Annem%20HayatiTehlikesiVardir%20Angiograf%C4%B1%20rapor.pdf) at any moment. They were trying to decide whether to do angiography or not. They were taking blood from my mother every 10 minutes, but the results were always the same, she could have a heart attack at any moment.

In the meantime, my sister stayed in the emergency service. I went home and cleaned myself, copied the camera recording to CD to give to the police and my lawyer, and returned to the emergency service. I received the [new forensic report stating my jaw was broken](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/Darp/AdliRapor_CenedeKirik.pdf) from the emergency service.

While I was there, my sister went home and came back. After she came, I went to orthodontics in the morning. In orthodontics, they made a 3D image of my mouth. The procedure which normally takes 20 minutes took 3 hours because my jaw was broken.

Meanwhile my lawyer came, I gave the camera recordings and the new forensic report to him; my lawyer took them to the police station.

#### My mother's surgery

After I finished my work at Orthodontics late in the evening, I learned that they transferred my mother to another hospital. They decided to do angiography, but Hacettepe was very busy. When I arrived at the other hospital, my mother's angiography was almost over. When the surgery was over, they took my mother to the room.

At that time, a professor from orthodontics called and warned me that I should never eat anything until the next day. He explained how they would fix my jaw for fracture treatment and explained that even if I ate the softest pasta, it would worsen the situation. That evening I stayed with my mother as a companion, my sister went home.

They discharged my mother in the morning. After taking her home, I bought the medical supplies requested by my doctor and went to orthodontics again. They could only put the brackets necessary to fix my jaw on my teeth in 4-5 hours.

#### My jaw was fixed

The next morning, on December 27, the splint was made. They put the splint in the orthodontics and fixed my jaw with elastics.

After leaving orthodontics, I went to the American passage and bought liquid protein kind of things; I didn't know how I would feed myself while my jaw was fixed yet. Since I had a splint in my mouth now, I couldn't speak, what I said wasn't understood; I could only agree with the seller youth by writing. That first day my jaw was fixed, it took me more than 2 hours to drink the first liquid meal.

### 2025

#### 6 weeks of treatment

For 1.5 months following the fixing of my jaw, I was going to orthodontics every 3-4 days, they were changing the elastics fixing my jaw, checking it. I went to plastic surgery once or twice in between, but they usually looked at the work done by orthodontics and said everything is fine, that's all.

In this 6-week period, I could only drink liquid things by trying to stick a straw into the gap at the very back of the teeth. But I tried different straws, any straw wouldn't work; the straw given by my doctor in orthopedics, used only to suck saliva in the dentist's chair, with a bendable tip, worked.

It took 3 hours each time to prepare liquid foods. It was necessary to cook it very well, pass it through a blender and then strain it with a strainer; otherwise particulate things never passed through the straw.

Beside the olive oil liquid food I prepared, my most important food source was baby biscuit I mixed into tea to get vitamins and minerals (even if I threw 5 biscuits into a mug of tea, they all melted) and ayran I made from yogurt to get calcium. I made it a routine to drink these several times a day.

This jaw fixing is not something like closing your mouth so that the teeth touch each other completely. You can't do a similar thing by closing your jaw and clenching your teeth, you can't simulate it. Because in jaw fixing there is something called a splint between the teeth. Moreover, if you don't have missing teeth (which I don't), the only opening remains that small opening at the very back of the teeth. When your jaw is fixed like this, you can't speak, no one understands the sounds you make. Since breathing through the mouth is very difficult, the nose shouldn't be blocked. Therefore, wherever I went, I definitely wore a mask to not get sick.

My jaw was broken and fixed, I couldn't eat, I couldn't speak and naturally I was weak. But I wasn't being looked after in a hospital or I didn't have a caregiver. Not only did I have to look after myself, I had to do everything myself; I was doing grocery shopping, going to and coming from the hospital, and buying my mother's medicines from the pharmacy.

Moreover, the threats of those below continued. Because, when his father saw me, he walked over me, tried to chase. I even couldn't go to the hospital in the last two weeks of my treatment, because the man was waiting for me in front of the apartment with a long pole (there is camera recording), entering the shop and hitting the ceiling (our floor) with that pole. His relatives in the janitor's apartment tried to walk over me and bump shoulders when they saw me. Therefore, except for Sundays, I didn't let my sister come to the apartment either.

Only I know what I went through in those 6 weeks. Indeed, at the end of 6 weeks I had fallen below 55 kilos.

#### Opening of my jaw

The professor in Plastics said they could remove the splint after the 4th week, but they didn't. Besides, my professor in orthodontics said it was too early. I was very demoralized then.

At the end of the sixth week, they removed the splint. Since I couldn't go to controls in the last two weeks because of those below, the elastics were about to break. Although I brushed my teeth 5-6 times a day and rinsed with Listerine, you would be surprised if you saw the state of the splint and my teeth. Also, tartars had formed; my doctor cleaned them. Doctors said the fracture on the left of my jaw was in good condition and I could eat things without forcing too much.

But, after the splint was removed and my jaw was opened, I couldn't start using my jaw as before immediately; I even barely brushed my teeth the first time. They sent me from orthodontics to physical therapy. Doctors said when the jaw stays fixed for 6 weeks, jaw joints are affected. Indeed, they gave jaw exercises in Physical Therapy.

But, it was obvious that there was a worse situation in my jaw. Because, while using my jaw during the following 2 weeks, I noticed that there was another problem around the right jaw joint. The right joint was moving too freely, crunching sounds were coming, sometimes something was even stinging. Therefore, I went to the doctor in plastics again, but the young people there gave the answer don't worry about it after making me wait for 2 hours. Realizing nothing would come out of there, I immediately went to the doctor in physical therapy and explained the problem. This doctor immediately noticed that the joint was moving too freely. After the professor in physical therapy examined too, they sent me to jaw (TMJ) MRI.

Jaw MRI was taken at the beginning of March. The result came out about 10 days later. The report said there was no problem inside the joint. Although physical therapy didn't understand why the joint moved too freely, they said no problem. My professor in orthodontics said there might be a problem in the right capsule and the sound might be coming from there. But since I survived a serious trauma, and we didn't know if the right jaw would improve or not, he said it wouldn't make much sense for me to struggle more.

Indeed, my right jaw joint still hasn't healed and doesn't look like it will heal much. Although the fracture on the left sometimes hurts slightly, it counts as in good condition. But if I have allergies, both jaw joints hurt.

In Hacettepe's report, this jaw fracture I experienced was written as a health problem carrying a difficulty of level 3 out of 5, that is, middle-highest level (I guess 4th and 5th levels were for situations requiring surgery). The court would give punishment according to this.

#### Leaving the apartment

1.5 months had passed after my jaw was opened but since I was still waiting for the MRI result in Ankara, I was living evasively because of the threats of those below. For example, I waited until they left in the evening and then went shopping. Sometimes they stayed in the shop until 8:30; therefore most markets were closed, only one market was open until 10.

My mother also couldn't even go out in the past 3 months. She couldn't go to the doctor. We weren't opening the door to anyone.

During this time, I completely packed the house, put everything in cardboard boxes. When I finished packing, we were in a condition to move the next day.

You can't know what kind of psychology all of this creates.

Therefore, a few days after the MRI report came out and I talked to the orthodontics professor, on March 15, around 3-4 am at night, I filled the car with everything I calculated I could take to the summer house and fit (I prepared for weeks by measuring and calculating and dreaming how much I could fill the car, luckily I calculated correctly, because I could fit everything I prepared into the car). Around 7 o'clock I had completely filled the car. I carefully closed the house and set off for the summer house with my mother.

We arrived at the summer house in the afternoon. That's when I could relax, because I wasn't living with the threat of those below anymore. For example, I could go out and shop whenever I wanted.

Two weeks later my sister and father also came to the summer house.

#### Insult and Assault lawsuits were filed

The file prepared by the police regarding the assault incident only went to the Prosecutor's Office at the beginning of March.

I learned from e-government that the insult lawsuit was filed at the end of July.

The assault lawsuit was also filed at the beginning of August.

#### UYAP and Gemini

I wasn't using UYAP until that time; I started using UYAP after seeing the lawsuits on e-government.

I saw that our files with my mother were combined in the assault case, but the Prosecutor's Office gave a Non-Prosecution decision regarding my mother's complaint. My lawyer also thought the Prosecutor's Office gave the correct decision; he was also saying there was no causal link between my mother's heart attack and my assault.

Whereas, my mother's complaint was "verbal violence". How can 9 "F.ck off" insults not be insults while "Pervert" is accepted as insult? The Prosecutor's Office gave a Non-Prosecution decision to these swear insults which have camera recording and my lawyer didn't object either.

That's when I realized I was alone; whatever I did, I would only do it myself. Actually lawyers don't do much, don't follow details, my lawyer didn't even understand what was going on.

Therefore, I started to enter UYAP every day and check developments.

Also, I realized I could benefit from artificial intelligence. First, I started by asking Gemini about judicial processes and legal terms. Then, I realized that Gemini actually understands law very well and can read and write all kinds of legal documents.

#### It fell on me

The reason I hired a lawyer in June 2024 was to file lawsuits regarding the illegal structure, janitor's apartment and the hole on the terrace. Although more than a year passed, instead of those lawsuits, we had assault and insult lawsuits in our hands. As a result, the lawyer I hired would only deal with those criminal cases and related compensation cases.

The essence of the matter is, if I don't deal with it myself, no one, including the Prosecutor's Office and my lawyer, had any intention of doing anything about all these main issues I have been dealing with for 10 years, which are the cause of insult and assault lawsuits. This was easily understood from the Prosecutor's Office giving a Non-Prosecution decision to my first complaint about the illegal structure. I wasn't using UYAP yet when the Non-Prosecution decision was notified to me. Therefore I asked my lawyer to object to the Non-Prosecution; he did, but it was rejected. Although I asked my lawyer many times, I still couldn't learn what was written in the rejection answer.

Moreover, my lawyer whom I hired to help and file a lawsuit in these matters I have been dealing with on my own for 10 years was trying to dissuade me, saying "since you don't live there anymore, why do you bother, let it go, let them do whatever they do". As if I haven't lost my home, as if they haven't broken my jaw, insulted and threatened, as if my mother almost didn't die. So, if it were up to my lawyer and the judiciary, there was a simple insult of the kind seen in fights between primary school children and an isolated assault event of the kind seen in those fighting in traffic. They would close everything by abstracting it from its context like this.

Indeed, it happened so in the insult case; the case is about to be closed with prepayment. The judiciary sold the insult done to me (which is not a simple insult; actually a pervert slander/blackmail) to the defendants for 13 thousand TL without asking me (9 thousand TL fine + 4 thousand TL court costs). So, anyone who wants can come and insult me for 13 thousand TL; they can even slander or set up blackmail, because it is simplified as insult anyway.

So the job fell on me. I had to do everything using UYAP and Gemini.

#### UYAP Editor and Mobile Signature

There are two ways to submit a petition to the Prosecutor's Office or the court: Taking a printout and giving it by hand or sending it from UYAP.

Since I am not in Ankara, I had to go to the courthouse here to give it by hand; which I sent my first declaration petition for the consolidation of the insult case with the assault case to the court by going to the courthouse.

But, if the petition size is long and petition attachments are many, giving by hand is not suitable at all. Because, you have to take pages of printouts, take them to the courthouse and they have to scan all pages one by one. Moreover, the image quality of scanned files is very bad (scanners in the courthouse are not very good, but even if it is the best scanner, one shouldn't expect a very good quality). Whereas, if there are documents like photos or collection receipts where detail is important among attachments, scanning quality is very important. Meanwhile, you can only give evidence like voice and camera recording with CD or USB memory.

Therefore, it was very important to use UYAP for all possible judicial works. But to do this, you need to write the petition using the UYAP editor and sign it electronically.

It might be logical for lawyers to sign using a USB key, but mobile signature was more suitable for an ordinary citizen like me. You need to buy a SIM card suitable for mobile signature, activate mobile signature and buy a mobile signature package. Doing all this from Turkcell is actually very easy; the only problem I had was, I struggled for 3 weeks to find a 128K SIM card compatible with mobile signature. But finally, in the 3rd week of September, I could now electronically sign documents I wrote using UYAP editor.

#### How I used Gemini

Since finding the SIM card took 3 weeks, I had quite a long time to write the criminal complaint petition regarding the illegal structure using Gemini. During this time, I also learned how to write legal documents with Gemini. For example, it is important to write a draft containing all information; Gemini is very successful in draft correction and translating it into a legal language. But, even in that case, it makes mistakes and can even skip information in the draft; one must be careful. After translating the draft into a petition, I was making corrections and additions in section and paragraph size; because Gemini couldn't keep the exact copy I had in its memory. Gemini helped a lot.

#### Illegal structure cover-up complaint

Thanks to this, first, I sent my complaint petition regarding the illegal structure cover-up on September 27. The subject I filed a criminal complaint about in that petition was actually not the existence of the illegal structure. There was no doubt about that anyway, individuals and the Municipality were openly confessing to the illegal structure. How can you deny a 100m2 reinforced concrete illegal structure anyway.

Therefore, the subject of the criminal complaint in that petition was that these individuals covered up the illegal structure many times with their extensions in the Municipality by using influence, closed the investigations by giving deceptive answers from the Municipality to the Prosecutor's Office and the Ministry many times, and irregularly cancelled the issued illegal structure penalty.

Since I complained about Çankaya Municipality and other individuals as suspects in the petition, the Prosecutor's Office separated my complaint into 2; one for civil servant crimes and the other for individuals. This is called separation (tefrik).

The Prosecutor's Office Civil Servant Crimes Bureau given a Non-Prosecution decision within 3 weeks. Because, they asked Çankaya Municipality for the illegal structure, they again gave an answer mocking our mind saying "since the door of the illegal structure is closed, it has become suitable for the architectural plan, there is nothing to do". This was actually the third cover-up answer given by the Municipality to judicial and administrative authorities. The Prosecutor's Office bureau also respected this and gave a Non-Prosecution decision with a reason that a criminal case cannot be filed for every negligence and I can file a lawsuit myself in administrative/civil courts.

Of course I objected to the Non-Prosecution at the Criminal Judgeship of Peace. Because, the subject of my petition was related to the cover-up of the illegal structure rather than the illegal structure. In my objection petition, I questioned how these individuals could cover up this illegal structure for 60 years without the Municipality, how they could extract cover-up answers from the Municipality to judicial and administrative authorities, how they could get the issued illegal structure penalty cancelled. In short, these crimes could not be committed without their extensions in the Municipality.

The Municipality, which wrote a penalty for the 3 m2 PVC cabinet I had built in my own garden for my bicycle, has done nothing for 60 years to a 100 m2 reinforced concrete illegal structure located in the common area of an apartment in the center of Ankara. Is the power of the state only enough for me?

We are waiting for the decision of the Criminal Judgeship of Peace.

#### Objection to insult decision

Immediately after this first illegal structure cover-up criminal complaint and Non-Prosecution objection, at the end of September, a simple procedure HAGB decision was given in the "Pervert" blackmail-insult case. That is, a decision was given without even holding a hearing, deferring the announcement of the verdict and not even recording it in the defendant's criminal record if he does not commit the same crime for 5 years.

Of course, I objected to this decision. In my objection petition, I explained that this was not a simple insult, but actually a blackmail attempt serving different purposes related to other crimes in the apartment and the assault case, and requested that this case be combined with the assault file.

The court giving the BYU HAGB decision accepted my objection; but I guess it had to accept it anyway. The Prosecutor's Office also added a seen letter to the file. The insult file was distributed again, that is, assigned to another court.

But the new court sent a prepayment warning to the other party in the same interim decision where it said it would switch to the general procedure with a hearing. That is, this was such a simple crime that let alone BYU HAGB, the case could be dropped by paying 13 thousand TL. Whereas, the method called prepayment is a method of reducing the workload of courts introduced to quickly close lawsuits filed regarding insults made from the Internet and social media. This "Pervert" blackmail had nothing to do with those kinds of insults. Such a decision did not do justice to the 15-minute camera recording and 18-page expert report. Of course, I will not attend the hearing of a court issuing prepayment; I will object when it drops the case with prepayment.

#### Janitor's apartment and other complaints

On October 30, I sent my second criminal complaint petition regarding the janitor's apartment and other issues to the Prosecutor's Office. In the petition,

- Illegal occupation of the janitor's apartment and fake rental agreement,
- Defrauding the SGK by employing uninsured janitor,
- Committing environmental and public health crime and damaging my apartment by pressing rainwater into the sewage pipe with illegal drainage on the terrace,
- Making illegal use of the apartment's electricity in the janitor's apartment,
- Swear insults to my mother,
- Attempting to demolish the apartment under the name of urban transformation to cover up evidence in the apartment and thus attempting to destroy evidence,
- Prostitution allegations regarding the individual staying in the janitor's apartment, harassment incidents of this individual against young girls and even trans individuals,
- I was reporting many crimes like these.

To this very carefully prepared complaint petition consisting of 13 pages, 11 evidences and 15 witnesses, the Prosecutor's Office Forgery and Fraud bureau gave a Non-Prosecution decision in 2-3 days. Actually, not much was written in the Non-Prosecution decision; obviously, the Prosecutor didn't even read the petition properly. In the decision, he copy-pasted my petition and said "legal dispute" at the end. All of these crimes, including sexual harassment, were legal disputes!

Of course, I immediately objected at the Criminal Judgeship of Peace. I even sent complaint petitions to SGK, ASKİ and Land Registry Cadastre by conducting the investigations myself that the Prosecutor's Office should have done. In my objection petition, I also stated that although the quality of the apartment is reinforced concrete, [it has been registered](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/KacakYapi/KacakYapiOrtbasUsulsuzAnaTasinmazNiteligi.pdf) as masonry in the title deed to gain advantage.

#### ASKİ's illegal drainage cover-up complaint

These individuals also covered up the illegal drainage complaint I made to Ankara Metropolitan Municipality ASKİ twice through their political/bureaucratic connections.

Therefore, at the end of December, together with the camera recording I took while my house turned flooded, voice recordings of phone calls with ASKİ and [all other evidences](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/YasaDisiDrenaj/YasaDisiDrenajOrtbasDelilCD.pdf), I sent my [cover-up criminal complaint petition](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/YasaDisiDrenaj/YasaDisiDrenajOrtbas.pdf) about ABB ASKİ and these individuals to the Prosecutor's Office. To the petition, I added complaints of high-level influence peddling and attempting to demolish the apartment for cover-up purposes. We are waiting for the result.

#### First hearing of the assault case

The first hearing of the assault case was held on December 16. This court listened to the nonsense of the false witness rejected by the Criminal Judgeship of Peace. Even the residence address the man told the court was a lie; the address he gave was the address of the printing shop. We also showed my mother and the courier youth who helped as witnesses.

The court of the assault case did not take into account my requests for consolidation with the insult case and petitions [where I explained the details of the insult to my mother](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/Darp/AnnemSozluSiddet.pdf), it wasn't even mentioned in the hearing; it is only written in the hearing minutes that the complainant's statements were read.

The court requested the preparation of the expert report of the camera recording. [Expert report](https://github.com/kwpnch/Adalet/raw/main/Darp/BilirkisiRaporu_evrak_13372356475.pdf) was made at the beginning of January.

My mother will testify in a court here on March 13, 2026.

#### Injunction order requests

Towards the end of December, to my urgent injunction order request against the destruction of evidence by attempting to demolish the apartment, sent to the Criminal Judgeship of Peace looking at my objection to the Non-Prosecution with Çankaya Municipality, the Criminal Judgeship of Peace and the Prosecutor's Office gave a negative answer.

But, the same Prosecutor's Office Civil Servant Crimes Bureau which gave the Non-Prosecution decision, just as it added under the Non-Prosecution decision, noted again in this new Non-Prosecution decision it gave: It wrote that the separated investigation carried out regarding the individuals in my illegal structure cover-up complaint on September 27 was continuing and the copy of my injunction order request was transmitted to that investigation file with a writ (writ is the name given to correspondence between the prosecutor's office and courts in the judiciary).

### 2026

#### Title deed irregularity complaints

At the beginning of January 2026, as an answer to my title deed irregularity complaint petition, Çankaya Land Registry Directorate directed to Ankara Cadastre Directorate.

Upon this, I wrote a complaint petition to Ankara Cadastre Directorate. Ankara Cadastre Directorate, ignoring the title deed irregularity and public loss, answered my complaint as if it was only a request for type change. It was saying type change could be done by interested persons giving a declaration.

Upon these evasive answers, we are waiting for the result of the complaint I made to the Prosecutor's Office about those responsible.

#### SGK complaint

We are waiting for the result of my SGK complaint regarding employment of uninsured janitor.

#### We Are Used to Cover-ups Now

But considering other answers I received from state institutions until today, I am not very hopeful. We are used to cover-up and ignoring answers coming from state institutions now.

#### Disclosure to press-media and journalists

At the beginning of January 2026, I sent a message explaining a summary of all this crime chain, evidences we have and the current situation to press-media institutions and journalists.

I opened the "Untouchables" Apartment web page for journalists.

I opened an X (Twitter @kwpnch) account and sent this page to many journalists and news channels via social media.

As of the end of January, no answer came from anyone; no one was even interested.

#### Analysis vs. Synthesis

The judiciary is in an effort to give separate punishment to each by dividing everything into small parts and analyzing. Because of this approach that cannot synthesize, this entire crime chain is simplified, so the judiciary is left with simple insult and isolated assault lawsuits that can be closed with money payment. With this approach, from a 15-minute camera recording and 18-minute expert report full of insults, threats, intimidation, slander/blackmail, confessions and challenges to judiciary/justice, only a single word "Pervert" insult and lawsuit, which can be said in just 1 second, is extracted. Exactly like in insult lawsuits between people who met in traffic for the first time in their lives and fought. No one looks at the whole picture. **This is not called "divide and conquer", it is called "divide and simplify", simplify until there is nothing important enough to judge left in hand.**

There is the first hearing of the Insult case on February 3. But, I have no intention of going to a court trying to drop the case with prepayment. Let them drop the case, I will object afterwards.

"Pervert" is of course an insult at the same time. But, if this case, which is related to all other crimes and is part of the blackmail, is to be dropped with prepayment like a simple insult, this simple question must also be answered: Where is the case containing this entire crime chain where blackmail and the instigator are also tried? Investigations regarding those crimes and individuals are continuing. So, the court should have either waited for the result of those investigations or combined the cases.

No one can convince me otherwise. Because, otherwise we resemble someone who can analyze but cannot synthesize, who sees the tree but misses the forest, who sees the virus scanning module but cannot see the security system it runs on.

Analysis not combined with synthesis has no meaning. Without looking at the whole picture, you cannot understand the reasons for the crimes you try to punish by dividing and fragmentation and finally you try to drop the case with prepayment like this.

Of course, the civil servant approach might also be in question here. Civil servants try to guarantee themselves; they make everything simplest and guaranteed. Besides, a person acting by thinking opposite of this cannot be a civil servant; otherwise a crime machine turns out to be a relative of the former President of the Constitutional Court, they exile the man from here to there.

So, the aim here is actually not to provide justice. It is not important that the state order is disrupted, that some people who think they are untouchable apply their own laws in the center of Ankara.

I have always fought with civil servant and politician approaches. I am not going to step back now.

Fight for justice continues.
